Fine-Tuned LLaMA 2 (7B) Notebook
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for fine-tuning LLaMA 2 (7B) on custom datasets. The notebook provides a step-by-step workflow for preparing data, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

🚀 Features
Preprocessing: Data loading, tokenization, and formatting for fine-tuning.

Fine-Tuning: Uses LoRA and PEFT for efficient model adaptation.

Inference: Generate responses from the fine-tuned model.

Evaluation: Assess model performance using qualitative and quantitative metrics.
